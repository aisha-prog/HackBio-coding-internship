# HackBio-coding-internship
This repository contains all projects carried out during the HackBio Coding internship.

#Stage_0 task
Each teammate's details, such as name, slack_username, email, hobby, country, discipline, and preferred_language, were retrieved and stored in a dictionary.
I then used the `print()` function to display the organized information in a structured format.

#Github 
 I created a GitHub profile and a new repository to store my code.
 Inside the repository, I added a folder named stage-zero to keep my Stage Zero solution.
